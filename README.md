## Analysis
Famous surfer W.Avy is looking to partner with us in opening a Surf and Ice Cream Shop in Oahu, Hawaii. Before providing us with additional funding we needed to run some weather analysis for the months of June and December to help determine if this kind of shop is sustainable year-round. To complete the analysis we had to retrieve data from multiple sources and build into one data source which made it easier for us to analyze.  

## Results
![Dec vs June Temps Stats](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79228491/131568956-3983bf0d-3907-481e-b3f4-09017509e8a4.PNG)

* The average temperature in June is about 74.94 degrees, this is almost 4 degrees higher than December (71.04)
* June temperature data had a tight bell curve distribution which gave June a smaller STD measure vs December by .47175
* June temperature data has a smaller range than December
  * June Range: 21 degrees - Max:85. Min:64
  * December Range 27 degrees - Max:83. Min:56   

## Summary
Based on my findings W. has asked for I would be confident that an ice cream and surf shop could operate year round. As I pointed out in my results the avgerage temperature difference in the two months in 4 degrees, this is a small variance specially with both months having average temperatures in the 70's. While the above data suites what W.Avy is looking for I do still think there would be some other meaningful data points to look at to help ensure a sustainable business operation. 

1. Because our data includes station locations, we could use this data to find a specific location in Oahu that has the highest weather averages.
2. Piggy backing off of our data set we also could develop a pricing strategy based on average temperature per Month, by creating an average temperature by month look we can surcharge are products in warmer months to help offset any potential loses from historically colder days.
